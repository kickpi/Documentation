# KickPi Documentation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development goals for the KickPi community documentation platform.  
KickPi aims to provide high-quality, open-source documentation for all KickPi development boards.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Current)
✔ Create KickPi GitHub organization  
✔ Start official documentation repository  
✔ Initial board documentation structure 
✔ Basic hardware overview and GPIO reference

**Goal:** Establish a reliable starting point for developers and early adopters.

---

## Phase 2 — Developer Onboarding
⏳ Flashing instructions  
⏳ First boot + SSH access documentation  
⏳ Troubleshooting and recovery notes  
⏳ Expand board-specific documentation folders

**Goal:** Provide a complete “zero-to-usable” workflow for new users.

---

## Phase 3 — Ecosystem Expansion
⬜ Add additional KickPi board documentation (K2C, future H-series, etc.)  
⬜ Standardize formatting and navigation across board docs  
⬜ Create shared hardware reference pages (Wi-Fi, I/O, serial, SoC specifics)  
⬜ Add early tooling (scripts/helpers for setup or testing)

**Goal:** Grow from a single-board reference to a multi-board ecosystem.

---

## Phase 4 — Community Adoption
⬜ Invite community contributors  
⬜ Add CONTRIBUTING and CODE OF CONDUCT guidelines  
⬜ Improve issue templates for documentation feedback  
⬜ Link ecosystem documentation from wikis and forums

**Goal:** Transition from single maintainer to community-driven documentation.

---

## Phase 5 — Platform Maturity
⬜ GitHub Pages or static website version of docs  
⬜ Versioned documentation releases (v1.0, v2.0, etc.)  
⬜ Integration with software projects or distros  
⬜ Long-term maintenance guidelines and governance model

**Goal:** Establish KickPi as the *official upstream documentation hub* for KickPi boards.
